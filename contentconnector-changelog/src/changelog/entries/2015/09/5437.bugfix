Search queries containing the characters '&', '|' or '~' returned unexpected results when
using the CRQueryParser and inherited classes because those characters where always 
replaced with 'AND', 'OR' and 'NOT'. This has been fixed: if those characters are 
escaped (using backslash '\') they won't be replaced anymore.
