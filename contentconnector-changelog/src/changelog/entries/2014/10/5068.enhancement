* The ITemplateManager interface in node-lib was updated. The render method will no longer throw CRException. Instead a normal Exception will be thrown.

* The PluggableActionCaller class was moved to portalnode-lib.
* The PortalNodeInteractor class is no longer interfacing directly with portalnode. Instead the PortalConnectorFactory class is used for datasource creation.
