Isolate the Velocity-runtime for the contentconnector. The contentconnector will now use
the new-able VelocityEngine class internally instead of the Velocity class singleton.
This ensures that the configuration of the Velocity engine in the contentconnector will
not interfere with that of other libraries or frameworks which use (and configure) the
singleton model.
